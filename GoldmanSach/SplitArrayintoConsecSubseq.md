### Problem Statement - 

You are given an integer array nums that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Determine if it is possible to split nums into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:

Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).
All subsequences have a length of 3 or more.
Return true if you can split nums according to the above conditions, or false otherwise.
### Sample Input
```
nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]
```
### Sample Output
```
true
Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 3, 4, 5
```

### Solution

```cpp

bool isPossible(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int,int> cnt, tails;
        for(int &i : nums) cnt[i]++;
        for(int &i : nums){
            if(!cnt[i]) continue;
            cnt[i]--;
            if(tails[i-1] > 0){
                tails[i-1]--;
                tails[i]++;
            }
            else if(cnt[i+1] && cnt[i+2]){
                cnt[i+1]--;
                cnt[i+2]--;
                tails[i+2]++;
            }
            else return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
